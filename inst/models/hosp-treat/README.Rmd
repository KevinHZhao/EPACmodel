### `hosp-treat` model

This version of the model has the same epidemiological structure as the `hosp` model, except we additionally track treated individuals in compartment $T$. Currently, all hospitalized individuals are treated and treatment has no effect on downstream outcomes in simulation. Essentially $T$ is just an accumulator compartment to track cumulative hospitalizations.

#### Input values

Input values are the same as for the `hosp` model:

```{r echo=FALSE}
params_df <- readr::read_csv(
    "figs/params_hosp.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE
)
DT::datatable(
    params_df,
    options = list(pageLength = 3),
    filter = "none"
)
```


#### Available scenarios {#available-scenarios-fyagm}

Available scenarios are the same as for the `hosp` model.
